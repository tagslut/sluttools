# Configuration for Music Automation Toolkit

# NOTE: Path configuration has been moved to the interactive configuration system.
# When you run the tools for the first time, you will be prompted to configure:
# - FLAC Library Directory (root directory of your FLAC collection)
# - Database Path (location of the FLAC index database)
# - Tool Paths (sox, metaflac executables)
# - Output Directories (matching results, resampled files, etc.)
#
# Your configuration will be saved to ~/.music_automation_config.json
# You can reconfigure paths by deleting that file or using the config management tools.
